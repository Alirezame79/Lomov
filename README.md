# Tools

this app is make by:

- React
- Redux

- Portal

# Challenges

Experts know that in a real app, all the parts are challeges. But of course I have sth to tell you in this section.

## 1. Ready API:

Using a Ready API is some how easy because you don't need to make the api by your own by on the other hand you have to check all the possibility in response when you have no document abount the APIs.

## 2. Good UI:

I try to make a good ui and because of that, I learned many tricks.

for example using dynamic background for an element and assign that in js file not css. I wrote an article about that in my blog account.

## 3. One Page:

I have no routes for this app so I should have handle that. App have two main page, one `App` for searching the title and the second one, `Modal` which show the result of the specific movie/series.
